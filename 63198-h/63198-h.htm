<p class="setting">Scene&mdash;Elegant Drawing-Room.  Door C., Sofa, R., Chairs, etc.
Table, L. C.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jennie</span>, C., <i>holding small bouquet in her hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jennie</span>.  Here is Mr. Eugene's bouquet, and now where is Mr. Eugene?  Not
here, of course, and I must be running all over the house to find him.
All a body has to do is to wait on him, that is what <em>he</em> thinks!  For
he is a lord of creation, he is!  And he must have his buttonhole
bouquet, and his hair parted in the middle, and his mustache waxed, and
everybody must bow down and worship him!  But after all, he isn't as bad
as his father.  Oh! isn't <em>he</em> just awful!  Dear me, what a terrible
thing it must be to think yourself so superior, all on account of your
sex!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>looking in</i>, C.).  May I come in?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>looking over shoulder</i>).  Oh!  You are here, are you?  I might have
known you would be!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>coming down</i> R. <i>awkwardly</i>).  Yes, because I always come where you
are, if I can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (L.)  Too bad, ain't it, I don't appreciate it any better?  You
haven't seen Mr. Eugene anywhere, have you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Seen him?  No!  That is, not since two o'clock this morning, when
I helped him up-stairs, and he called me his darling Jim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  How awful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  I guess you would have said so if he had hugged you the way he did
me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>coquettishly</i>)  Well, I don't know; perhaps that might not have
been quite so awful either!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>walking about angrily</i>).  Just let me catch him hugging you, or any
other fellow, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Dear me!  And what business would that be of yours, I should like
to know?  This is a free country, sir, and I am a single woman, and
hugging isn't a crime, and no man shall dictate to me.  So! (<i>Stamps
foot</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Who <em>is</em> dictating?  How you do fly off!  You know, Jennie, I
think all the world of you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes, I dare say!  Men always say so <em>before</em> they get married.  I
suppose that is what our master said to our mistress once, and now see
the way he orders her about!  And you would like to do the same by me,
wouldn't you?  But I am altogether too smart for that, sir!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  But, good gracious, Jennie, how you do fly off!  Never thought of
such a thing in my life!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Oh, pshaw!  Men are all alike!  Now I will bet a pound of candy
that you think you know more than I do, just because you are a man!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Well&mdash;I&mdash;of course about some things.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Some things! just tell me one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Well&mdash;I&mdash;you see it would take me some time to think.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes, I guess it would!  Well, I have my eyes open, and I haven't
lived in this house going on a year for nothing, and seen the airs
master and Mr. Eugene give themselves!  Over Miss Kate, too, who knows
more than both of them put together.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>gesticulating</i>).  But, Jennie, a woman isn't <em>supposed</em> to know as
much as a man.  It isn't natural, you see!  But a man likes them all the
better for it, and he likes to be looked up to, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>drawing herself up</i>).  You don't say so!  How sorry I am I can't
make you happy in that way.  But the fact is, I'd rather have a man who
likes me for what I know and not for what I <em>don't</em> know!  So
(<i>courtesying</i>) I'll leave you to find a woman with less brains than you
have&mdash;<em>if you can</em>. (<i>Exit</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>following</i>).  Jennie! here, Jennie!  She has gone and she is mad!
How she does fly off!  And oh, how I do love her!  Good gracious, how
I do love her! (<i>Comes down</i> C.)  Now why on earth should she get mad
about a little thing like that!  Does she want me to say every man is
a natural-born fool?  Hang me if I don't believe they are, where a woman
is concerned!  Here for the last six months I've been a perfect slave to
her.  And all I get for it is to be told I belong to a tyrannical sex!
But I won't stand it.  No, I won't! (<i>Going.  Stops at door</i> C.)  I am
afraid I can't help it, though.  Oh, what an awful thing it is to be in
love!  And between me and the furniture, I do believe if a woman <em>is</em>
the weaker sex, she always gets the best of a man somehow.  (<i>Exit</i>,
L. 2 E.)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Grovenor</span> <i>and</i> <span class="character">Alice</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>as she enters</i>).  Well, no, my dear, Dr. Endicott is not a
particularly good match.  But Mr. Doughlass has an immense fortune,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>sits</i> R. <i>on sofa</i>).  Yes, but Mr. Doughlass is <em>such</em> a bore, ma.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>sitting</i>, L.).  Ah, well, a bore is better than a tyrant, child.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  But there must be some men who are neither.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  That kind are very hard to find, and, by some strange chance,
are usually poor in purse when found.  Witness Dr. Endicott, for
instance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  It would never do to marry a poor man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Do!  With your extravagant tastes it would be madness.  I have
no doubt Mr. Doughlass would make you a very good husband, and it is
time you were thinking of settling in life now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  But Kate is older than I am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  I fear poor Kate will surely be an old maid, in spite of all I
can do.  Alas! there has never been one in the family yet, and to think
one of <em>my</em> daughters should be first to bear that stigma is terrible to
contemplate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Isn't it strange that she <em>never</em> tries to be attractive to
gentlemen?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  And she actually wants to vote.  I am sure I cannot conceive
where she obtained such thoughts.  Certainly not from <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Kate</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>stopping at door</i>).  You are mistaken, mother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span> (<i>rising quickly</i>).  <em>You</em> here, Kate?  How you do startle one!
What do you mean by that remark?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>coming down</i> C.).  I mean, mother, that I first conceived my horror
of occupying a dependent position from seeing how you were obliged to
coax and manage, to bear cross looks and sarcastic remarks, whenever
you asked father for money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>looking around alarmed</i>).  Hush!  Do not speak so loud; your
father is in the library, and might hear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am not afraid to say to any one that I had rather earn <em>my</em>
money than have it doled out to me as a favor grudgingly bestowed.
(<i>Sits at table</i> L. C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>sitting</i> L.).  I will admit, Kate, that it has always been very
hard to obtain money from your father; and now listen to reason.  You
are aware that we spend every cent of our income in order to keep up our
style of living.  The future of you two girls cannot be provided for by
us, so there is but one thing for you to do,&mdash;to marry.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Are you sure that is the only thing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Why, what else is there&mdash;for a woman?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Many women are independent by the fruit of their own exertions.
Why could not I be?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>with slight scream</i>).  You quite shock me.  Do you not know you
would lose your position in society by such a course?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am willing to lose it, if to keep it I must barter my own
self-respect.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Barter your self-respect!  What <em>do</em> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I mean sell myself for the sake of being supported in idleness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>languidly fanning herself</i>).  The idea of a lady actually wanting
to work!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  <em>I</em> cannot live on husks, Alice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  I cannot understand why you should be so opposed to marriage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  You mistake me very much if you think I am.  Oh, no!  I know well
that the deepest and truest happiness in life is in love and marriage.
It is against making marriage a trade, degrading it to a means of
support, that I protest, with all my soul!  (<i>Rises</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  A trade!  How absurd!  Would you marry a poor man for love?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Without an instant's hesitation, and I would never be a dependent
burden on him!  Oh! mother, can you not see how much of the misery in
the world is caused by the way girls are educated, in helpless
dependence, often obliged to sell themselves to the first man who
offers, because they cannot support themselves?  Do not condemn me to
such a fate.  Give me a chance to be independent of all such
considerations in my choice of a husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>with impatient gesture</i>).  Nonsense.  You are crazy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  The best thing you can do, Kate, is to set your cap for Dr.
Endicott.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am very much mistaken in Dr. Endicott if he would deign to
notice a woman who had stooped to set her cap.  (<i>Sits</i> L. C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>sighing</i>).  I am sure I do not know what will become of you with
such ideas.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>outside</i>).  Where is Eugene?  I want him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Hush! here comes your father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>starting up from reclining position</i>).  Oh, mother! <em>do</em> try to
get some money of him for a new ball dress.  Mine are shameful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  I will do my best, but it is hard work.  I hope you may never
know how hard when you have a husband of your own.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mr. Grovenor</span>, C., <i>his hands full of papers, bills, etc</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>very crossly</i>).  Where is that boy?  What do these bills mean?
The expenses of this house <em>must</em> be cut down.  Do you think I am made
of money, Mrs. Grovenor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>timidly</i>).  I am very sorry.  I am sure I do the best I can.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>sitting</i> R. <i>of table and looking over bills</i>).  I think you would
find a way to be more economical if you had to earn the money you spent.
It's a pity you women did not have to do it once in a while, and then
you would know how good it was.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>leaning on table, earnestly</i>).  That is just what I wish to do,
father.  Give me the chance and I will relieve you of the burden of my
support.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>staring at his own papers</i>).  You would do fine things, I dare
say.  I do not believe you know exactly what you are talking about, but
then a woman never does.  Now, for instance, how long do you suppose it
would take you to earn that dress you have on, at women's average wages?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I could wear a cheaper dress, if need be.  I am aware that men,
in whose hands now rests the power, show their boasted "chivalry" to the
so-called "weaker sex" by paying her half they pay a man for the same
work.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>dropping papers angrily</i>).  What confounded folly you talk!  If a
woman did her work as well as a man she would get the same wages; but
she does not.  She isn't thinking of her work.  When she is young she
is thinking of getting married, when she is old she is mad because she
can't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).  Pardon me, father, but I think it is you who are
talking folly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Humph!  I suppose you would like to vote?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I see no reason why I should not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>rises and looks her over, then looks at</i> <span class="character">Mrs. G</span>.)  What kind of
sentiments have you instilled into your eldest daughter, Mrs. Grovenor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  <em>I</em>, Mr. Grovenor!  Do Kate's remarks sound like <em>my</em>
teachings?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (C.).  Well, no, I will acquit you of ever having any tendencies
towards doing anything to bring money into the family, Mrs. Grovenor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Father, I have some artistic talent, I think; why may I not study
and become an artist?  All I ask is that I may not be a burden on you
or any one (<i>going to him</i>).  You will not refuse me this, father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>putting arm around her</i>).  There, there, Kate, you are a good
girl, and if you was only a boy I would make something of you; but as
you are not, the best advice I can give you is to go and marry some good
man and forget these foolish ideas of yours about voting and all that
stuff.  (<i>Going, stops</i>.)  Mrs. Grovenor, send that boy to me at once, do
you hear?  Here is a bill of his for champagne that is something
frightful!  He certainly has inherited your extravagant taste.  (<i>Exit</i>,
C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>rising</i>).  There, Kate, you heard what your father said.
Perhaps you will take his advice if you will not take mine.  Do you
think you can find Eugene?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I will try.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  They all discourage me, but I will not
be daunted!  (<i>Exit</i>, L. 2 E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  You did not say a word about my dress, mother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  But he is in such a bad humor!  However, I will go now and see
what can be done.  Talk about earning money!  I am sure I doubly earn
every cent I get from Mr. Grovenor, and always have.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  I believe father grows more stingy every day.  Oh, dear! I
suppose I shall have to marry that dreadful Mr. Doughlass.  What a
strange girl Kate is!  And yet I do not know, I am not sure but what it
would be nice to be independent.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jennie</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>coming down and handing card</i>).  Are you at home, Miss Alice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>takes it and reads</i>).  "Harold Doughlass."  Yes (<i>sighs</i>), I suppose
so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes'm.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  <em>He</em> is one of the superior sex, and he don't
know so much as an idiot!  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Now, were I independent, I should certainly have said I was
engaged and could not see him.  How shall I be able to endure him for a
life time, when he bores me so for an hour?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Doughlass</span>, <i>eye-glass, cane, etc</i>., C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>rising</i>).  I am delighted to see you, Mr. Doughlass!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (C.)  Aw! thank you.  You are looking more chawming than ever this
evening, Miss Alice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>aside</i>).  He always says that.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  You quite flatter me.
Please be seated.  (<i>Offers chair</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (<i>sitting</i>, L.).  Aw! this has been a fine day hasn't it, now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>sitting</i>, R.).  Very fine indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  I hope we shall have as fine to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  I hope so, truly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  But I weally feaw we shall have wain.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  You quite alarm me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw! I do not like wain.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Nor I.  (<i>Aside, yawning</i>.)  Can't he talk about something besides
the weather?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (<i>adjusting eye-glasses</i>).  I hope your pawents are both well!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Quite well, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  I need not ask if you are, for you look more chawming than usual!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Ah! you are very complimentary.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  How many times is he
going to say that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw! yes, you are always chawming to me, you know!  (<i>Aside</i>.)  A
fellow must flatter these girls.  That's the secret!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  You quite confuse me.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  Is he going to propose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw! I&mdash;aw&mdash;I twust you do not dislike to be confused, because I
think you chawming, you know?  (<i>Goes and sits beside her on sofa</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Of course I am only too pleased to be so favored.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Yes&mdash;aw&mdash;and some day I shall tell you just how chawming I do
think you.  You are so different from your sister, you know.
Why&mdash;aw&mdash;but weally a fellow is quite afwaid of her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Afraid?  What, you afraid of a lady?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Well, not&mdash;not exactly afwaid, of course, but you see&mdash;aw&mdash;I
never know what to say to her.  We fellows do not like
these&mdash;aw&mdash;strong-minded ladies, you know.  We like these&mdash;aw&mdash;gentle,
clinging, soft girls, that do not know so much, you know, of whom you,
Miss Alice, are such a chawming type!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>rising</i>).  Indeed.  Thanks for the implied compliment to my
intellect, sir!  (<i>Crosses to</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Eh?  (<i>Aside</i>.)  What the deuce did I say to put her out like that?
(<i>Aloud</i>.)  I mean that you are vewy chawming, the style of girl we
fellows pwefer, you know.  (<i>Rises and bows low</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>aside</i>).  It will not do to get angry with him yet.  But if I
marry him I'll let him know whether I have any brains or not!  (<i>Aloud</i>.)
Indeed, Mr. Doughlass?  But really, I do not think Kate so very
formidable.  Ah! here she comes now.  (<i>Goes to</i> R. C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  I'm sorry&mdash;aw&mdash;to have our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> interrupted, and I am
sure I do not know what to say to her, nevaw do, you know!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Kate</span>, L. 2 E., <i>and bows to</i> <span class="character">Doughlass</span> <i>coldly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (<i>aside</i>).  She looks at a fellow in a way that fweezes him all
over.  Aw&mdash;I'll flatter her.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  Aw&mdash;you are looking as chawming
as usual, Miss Grovenor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am very glad if you have been so fortunate as to discover the
fact.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (<i>aside</i>).  That always does please them, to be sure.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Eugene</span>, L. 2. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>going to</i> C.)  Well, Kittie, here I am; now where is the governor,
and what's the row?  Ah, Harold, my boy, how are you?  Where were you
last night?  Jolly old time the boys had.  But champagne does make a
fellow feel like the deuce the next day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (L.).  Is it worth while to drink it, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Oh! come now! don't preach.  Confound it, a woman is always
preaching.  If they had their way a fellow would have no fun at all,
eh, Harold?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  No&mdash;aw&mdash;that is, the ladies think so much of us, they want to
make us saints, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Can't be done, though, eh?  What is the use of living if a man
can't have a good time?  (<i>Sings</i>.)  By Jove, I am glad I wasn't born a
woman.  They take things too seriously altogether.  But they look up
to us, for all their preaching, eh, Harold?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (R.).  To be sure&mdash;aw.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  That must require quite a stretch of the imagination sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Hope that isn't personal, Kittie.  Never mind, you will be proud
of me some time, only a fellow must have his fling, you know.  Now I
must go and get my dose from the governor.  By by, Harold, see you
again.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Poor Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  I beg pardon.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  What the deuce ails her now?  (<i>Aloud</i>.)
Poor Eugene?  Why, he is the liveliest fellaw I know.  The boys nevaw
think of having a champagne supper without Eugene, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am sorry if my brother is sought only for the purpose of
gracing champagne suppers and disgracing himself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;weally, now, weally, aren't you a little too severe.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (C.).  Of course she is.  A young man must sow his wild oats.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (L.).  But I believe a young lady is not allowed that privilege.
What is wrong for one must be for the other?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  You shock me, Kate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;weally now, 'pon my honor, that is such a strange wemark,
Miss Grovenor; a lady is of course above such things.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Then in that respect, at least, she must be superior to a man.
I am glad to hear you acknowledge even so little.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;now&mdash;aw&mdash;you quite confuse me.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  I must go wight
away; never could stand these strong-minded ladies.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  Aw&mdash;I&mdash;I
never argue with a lady, you know.  But I am afwaid I shall have to tear
myself away, as I have a very particular engagement.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  I am so sorry!  But we shall see you again soon?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;vewy soon&mdash;aw&mdash;I should only be too happy to wemain forever
in your chawming pwesence.  (<i>Kisses her hand, bows to</i> <span class="character">Kate</span>, <i>and exit</i>,
C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Well, you have driven him away.  It will be very convenient to
have you around <em>after</em> he and I are married, but previously the
experiment is too dangerous, and I shall have to ask you to be kind
enough to keep your strange ideas exclusively for our family circle.
(<i>Exit</i>, L. 2 E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Strange ideas!  Is it so strange to long to be independent?  Is
it strange to shrink from being a burden on an already over-burdened
father, or dependent upon the whims of some unloved husband?  Is it
strange to wish to exercise the talents and energy God has given you
instead of allowing them to rust out in darkness?  Does the fact of my
being a woman make me content to drift along aimlessly, in a stream that
leads nowhere?  No! a thousand times, no!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jennie</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Dr. Endicott, miss.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Please ask him in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes'm.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  <em>He</em> is a man what <em>is</em> a man.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I wonder does he, too, think me strange?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Dr. Endicott</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>coming down</i> L.).  At last I am with you once more, where I
should have been long ago had not duty called me elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am delighted to welcome you.  Father was saying yesterday he
wished to see you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Oh, yes, there is a little business matter between us.  And
what have you been doing since I was last here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Nothing?  Really nothing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Oh, I have embroidered a little, painted a little, and practised
music a little.  But it all amounted to&mdash;as I said&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  It served to pass away the time pleasantly, at least.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Yes.  But is that what we are living for, to pass away time?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  You are right.  Such a life is not suited to a woman of your
temperament.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  But what can I do?  Father and mother object to my doing anything
that is real.  Because I seek some aim in life, because I seek an
independent position, they call me unwomanly and strange.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Is it indeed so?  Alas that these old prejudices of a by-gone
age should trammel a woman now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I just frightened Mr. Doughlass away with my strange ideas.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>laughing</i>).  Poor Harold!  But you cannot frighten <em>me</em> away,
Miss Grovenor.  It is just this free, untrammelled, independent woman we
need in the world now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (C.).  I can feel now that I have one friend who knows and
sympathizes with me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>going towards her</i>).  And who honors you above all women.  Kate,
may I add that this woman I have described is the woman I want at my
fireside for my companion, friend, and my wife?  There is one woman who
is all I ask, one woman whom I love, but I dare not even hope for her
favor.  (<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Eugene</span>, C.)  That woman, Kate, is&mdash; (<i>Takes her hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>coming down</i> C. <i>between them</i>).  That's right, doctor, shake hands
with her, but after that keep at a discreet distance, for she hates men,
you know.  Wants to vote and smoke cigars, and wear bloomers and all
that sort of thing, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (R.).  Eugene!  I am ashamed of you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Ah, never mind me, sis.  The doctor won't take too much stock in
what I say, will you, doctor.  And as for you, Kit, you will get over
all those notions of yours some day and acknowledge that we men are
capable of taking care of the nation, eh, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (L.).  Such very excellent care as we take of it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  And such pains as you take to elect none but honest men to
office!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Ha! ha! that isn't a bad one for you, sis, it's a pity you are a
woman, for you would have been a smart man and no mistake.  But what the
deuce of a temper the governor is in!  Making such a fuss over a little
bill for our champagne supper last night as I never heard.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I wish you would let champagne alone, Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Now don't preach.  Say, can't you coax some money out of him some
way?  You women know how to do that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I fear I am deficient in that feature of our sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Oh, hang it! but I must have the money some way.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Lizzie</span>, C.  <i>Looks at</i> <span class="character">Kate</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lizzie</span>.  Excuse me, but I was told I should find Mrs. Grovenor here.
Are you the lady?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>aside</i>).  By Jove, Lizzie, and here!  (<i>Goes to</i> L. <i>of</i> <span class="character">Dr. E</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Please come in and be seated.  I will call mother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>entering and going down</i> R.).  I believe she advertised for a
seamstress, and I&mdash; (<i>Looks at the gentlemen, screams, and sinks into
chair</i>, R. C.  <span class="character">Dr. E</span>. <i>and</i> <span class="character">Kate</span> <i>go to her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>aside</i>).  This is devilish awkward.  Hope she will know enough to
hold her tongue.  By Jove, I'm in a fix all around.  (<i>Exit hastily</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>as Lizzie revives</i>).  Are you better?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Yes&mdash;I&mdash;yes, thank you.  (<i>Looking around.  Aside</i>.)  He has gone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  The heat of the room overpowered her, doubtless.  I will leave
her to your care while I go and see your father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  You will find him in the library.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I will soon return.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>aside</i>).  She looked very strangely at the doctor before she
fainted.  What can it mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  I&mdash;I beg pardon for troubling you so much.  I cannot imagine what
made me so dizzy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I am very glad you have recovered.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Thank you.  I&mdash;I will go now.  (<i>Rises</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  But I thought you wished to see my mother?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Yes&mdash;but I&mdash;I think I cannot attend to it now.  (<i>Goes up</i> C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>aside</i>).  There is something strange in her behavior.  I will try
and find out what is the matter.  Perhaps I can help her.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  Do
not go until you are quite well.  I thought you recognized the&mdash;the
gentleman who was here just now.  May I ask if it was so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>coming down</i> R. <i>confusedly</i>).  Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I have seen him before, in
the country, where I lived.  He boarded there one summer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (L.).  Then you are acquainted?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (C.).  Acquainted?  Have I not sat by his side hour after hour
underneath the trees and&mdash;oh! what have I said?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>aside</i>).  Why do I tremble?  (<i>Aloud, going to her</i>.)  Do not fear,
child, have confidence in me and let me be your friend.  I see you have
some great trouble.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Forgive me for having said what I did, but his appearance took me
so by surprise, and I have not yet recovered myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>putting arm around her</i>).  Poor child, tell me all without fear,
and I will do anything I can to help you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  You are good and kind, I know, and I will confide in you.  He&mdash;he
told me he loved me, and I&mdash;I&mdash;believed it.  And I loved him with all my
heart.  Life was nothing to me without him.  But one day, with promises
to return soon and make me his wife, he left me and I never saw him
again until to-day.  Ah! it broke my heart! it broke my heart!</p>

<p>(<i>Sinks sobbing on chair</i>, R. C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (C., <i>aside</i>).  And I, too, loved him.  And he dared to speak of love
to me, after having ruined the happiness of this confiding child.  He
whom I thought so good, so noble, who was my ideal of what a man should
be.  And how unmoved he was in her presence.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  Poor girl (<i>goes
to</i> <span class="character">Lizzie</span>, <i>kneels and puts her arm around her</i>), you have my deepest
sympathy.  Be brave; he is not worth those tears.  I will be your friend
and comfort you all I can.  Here (<i>rising</i>), go in this room; he will be
back soon and I do not wish you to have the pain of meeting him.  What
you have told me shall be sacred.  I will see you again soon.  (<i>Takes
her to</i> R.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Ah! thank you a thousand times for your goodness.  (<i>Exit</i>, R.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Yes, he is coming back.  Will he speak of his love again,
trusting to her silence?  His love?  His noble words but now were decoys
to catch the hand of a supposed heiress by pandering to her theories.
Ah, heavens! is there no truth in the world?  Unhappy, indeed, must the
woman be whose whole life is dependent on the truth or falsehood of a
man.  Oh, woman's heart! who can escape the suffering its tenderness
brings?  Strong-minded let me be, and deal with him as he deserves!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Dr. Endicott</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>coming down</i> R.).  I am happy to say your father and I have
settled our little affair with mutual satisfaction; and now, Kate (<i>going
to her</i>), may I finish the sentence so rudely interrupted?  May I dare to
ask the one woman in the world for me, to share my life?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>turning from him</i>).  I should hardly think you <em>would</em> dare, sir.
(<i>Goes to</i> L.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Kate, do I merit that strange tone of severity?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Sir, do you think you are worthy of such a woman as you have
described?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  No, Kate, no man is.  But I would hope by her aid and the
influence of her pure example to make myself more worthy day after day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Your hypocrisy deceives me no longer, Dr. Endicott.  The man I
marry I must honor as well as love.  I cannot honor you.  Farewell.

Mr. Grovenor is cross all the time, Mrs. Grovenor is frightened all the

time, and Mr. Eugene is drunk&mdash;I mean jolly&mdash;all the time.  Dr.
Endicott don't come here any more, Eyeglass Doughlass is here all the

man is to get married and saddle himself with an expensive family!
Well, there is one consolation, my girls will be off my hands some time.
Not a bad bargain will the man make who gets Kate.  It's a pity, a great
pity she isn't a boy.  A very different son she would have been to me
from the one I have.  If I had time to spare from money matters, Eugene
would give me great anxiety.  Here is that note of Brown's due next
week; how am I to meet it?  But it must be done or my credit is lost!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  He had no business to do it.  He had no business to be so near
you; I won't stand by and see it done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Weally, this is a most extraordinary thing!  Look here, fellow&mdash;
(<i>Going towards him</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Don't call me fellow, sir.  (<i>Crossing to</i> L.)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Dr. Endicott</span>, L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>coming down</i> R. C.).  Oh, Mr. Doughlass, you here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;yes, happy to see you.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  Good gwacious!  It will
never do to have him catch me in a wow with the coachman.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)
Aw&mdash;I was about leaving.  Here, my good fellow.  (<i>Gives money to</i> <span class="character">Jim</span>
<i>and exit</i> L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>looks at money, then throws it after him</i>).  There, sir!  You will
find money is not a plaster for everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Ain't you ashamed of yourself, Jim!  Is this the way you show
your superiority, I'd like to know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (C.).  What does all this mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Excuse me, sir, it's nothing but a little quarrel that Jennie and
I were having.  Nothing uncommon, sir.  She is like all women, the
better a man likes her the worse he gets treated.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Do not listen to him, please, doctor.  It's all a bit of nonsense,
anyway.  If that last you said is true, Jim, all I have got to say is
that it shows a great weakness in the sex.  (<i>Exit</i>, L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  There you hear her, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Your sweetheart is a little wilful, I fear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Sh! don't let her hear you say that, for she ain't my sweetheart,
you know.  That is, she won't acknowledge it.  It's me who am a dangling
and a dangling after her, and she is laughing at me, or berating me for
it all the time.  Oh, sir! it is an awful thing to be in love.  Why,
sir, if this goes on much longer, I shan't have flesh enough left to
keep my bones together with.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Then why do you not insist on either yes or no from her and
abide by it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  <em>Insist</em>, did you say, sir?  <em>Insist</em>?  Why, sir, I have to get
down on my marrow bones, sir, and then she ain't satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  But what does she wish you to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  I'll tell you what she wants, sir.  She wants me to give up the
dignity of my sex.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (<i>surprised</i>).  I fear I do not quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  She wants me to acknowledge that I am a fool, sir; nothing will
content her but my admitting I am a perfect fool.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  That is very strange.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  You see, she thinks it her duty to sit down on me! just to show
she ain't inferior, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I am afraid she and you also have gone to the two extremes of an
idea.  Now I do not believe you would wish to exercise any undue
authority over her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Authority? over Jennie?  No, indeed, sir, and to tell you the
truth, I don't believe there is any fellow alive who <em>could</em> do it and
live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I have more faith in Jennie than to believe she would really
like a man who was inferior to herself.  I think she adopts that tone
as a safeguard because she has a misgiving that the masculine instinct
is to assert itself over the feminine.  But if you give her to
understand that as far as you are concerned she is wrong, I think there
will be no trouble.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Thank you, sir, I'll try.  I suppose a man and a woman <em>are</em> two
halves, equal halves, but I have a feeling that Jennie won't be content
with half; she will want two thirds at least.  (<i>Exit</i>, L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Poor fellow, I trust his Jennie will not be obdurate.  As he
says, it is an awful thing to be in love.  Love!  Is it a blessing or a
curse?  A week ago, and for me it meant happiness, and now&mdash;ah, Kate,
what is it that stands between us?  I can obtain no explanation from
her; she refuses to see me alone.  Is it what a man who has less faith
in the sex than I would call a woman's caprice?  No!  Kate is a noble,
a true woman, nothing can make me doubt that!  "I must honor as well
as love the man I marry."  What can she have meant?  What have I done?
I am groping in the darkness, but I will find my way into the light yet!</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mr. Grovenor</span>, R. 1 E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Ah, my dear doctor, you are a stranger indeed.  I sent for you
to-day, as I am feeling far from well.  I have had a great mental strain
of late and I fear it has been too much for me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I can truly believe it.  I am grieved to see you looking so ill.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  My head troubles me sadly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  You need rest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Rest!  Rest is impossible for me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Cannot your son&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Eugene! no!  He is good for nothing except to sing comic songs
at champagne suppers and talk soft nonsense to equally soft girls.  No.
I regret to say Eugene is not a son of whom I can be proud, or who is
willing to be useful to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  But your daughter Kate.  I am positive she could be of great
assistance to you if you would allow her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  What! a woman meddling in my business matters?  Absurd!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I am sorry I cannot agree with you.  I know Miss Grovenor has
business ability, energy, and brains; what more do you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  But she is a woman and that settles the matter.  Let us not
discuss this point.  And now can you not give me something that will
stop this burning in my head?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I will try, but I fear, without rest, medicine will do you
little good.</p>

I must.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Do not go, I was about leaving.  May I ask to be favored with an

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  What I say, father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I appeal to your sense of justice.  Is it right to refuse me all

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I thank you.  Pardon me, Mr. Grovenor, but as this is a matter
that concerns me very nearly I could do no otherwise than speak in your

soon.  To-morrow at this hour, Kate, I hope to clear up all your doubts.

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  What cursed nonsense is all this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Nothing, father, only Dr. Endicott asked me to be his wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  The devil he did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  And I refused.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  What! refused? why, you are a bigger fool than most women!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Thank you, father.  But in a matter like that, you must allow
even a woman has the right to choose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  And are you expecting a prince, that the doctor, a fine,
handsome man, is not good enough for you?  It is not every one who would
want you, with your unfeminine ideas!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Well, father, I think I can manage to exist unmarried.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Exist? on what?  I have no property to leave you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Then at least I shall escape taxation without representation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  There you go again with your crazy ideas!  I declare I have no
patience with you.  What was that he meant about an explanation?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  That I am not at liberty to tell, as it is a secret that concerns
others.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  A secret?  Ah, well, it will come out soon enough, then.  No
woman yet ever kept a secret.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  We shall see.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Well, Kate, I will not deny you have always been a good girl; I
believe you never teased me for money in your life, but you were a fool
to refuse the doctor.  However, there is no accounting for a woman's
whims, and you may think better of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Let us dismiss that subject.  I came here, father, to beg you to
let me help you.  I know you are ill and need rest.  I know you are
oppressed by many cares, while I&mdash;I have absolutely nothing to fill my
time.  I feel I could help you.  Forget I am a woman, if need be, and
let me try.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  I know you mean right, child, but if I should agree to your
proposition, you would be more bother than you were worth; don't you
see you would, you goose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  At first I might until I learned your way.  But that would not be
long; at least let me try.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Well, some time when I have plenty of time, perhaps, I will see!
(<i>Sits at desk</i>, R.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  You only say that to get rid of me.  Is there no way I can induce
you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  No, no.  Now do not annoy me any more.  (<i>Writes busily</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Mrs. Grovenor</span>, L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (L.).  Ah, Kate, you here?  I would like to speak to your father
alone a moment, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Very well, mother.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  Poor father so worn and harassed.
I know I could lighten his labors.  Why is he so obstinate?  (<i>Exit</i>
L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>without looking at her</i>).  Well, Mrs. Grovenor, what is
it&mdash;money?  You can't have it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Not for myself.  But Eugene is in great distress.  He says he
must have five hundred dollars at once, and goes on in a way that is
frightful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>looking over shoulder</i>).  Five hundred dollars!  Do you see that
note, due next week and not a cent raised to pay it with?  Do you see
these bills?  Go back and teach your son to earn his money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>. (<i>putting handkerchief to eyes</i>).  Oh, would I not if I could!
But alas!  I am helpless and Eugene is going to ruin!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>writing</i>).  There, do not snivel.  You have an easy time enough.
So spare a man at least your everlasting whimpering!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  An easy time?  Bound, fettered, helpless, is that easy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>turning in his chair and staring at her</i>).  You are in an
extraordinary mood to-day, Mrs. Grovenor!  Bound, fettered&mdash;clothed,
fed, given all the luxuries of life without lifting your own white
hands, you mean.  Helpless?  To raise five hundred dollars to pay
Eugene's&mdash;gambling&mdash;debts&mdash;doubtless.  Who has been talking such stuff
to you?  Kate?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mrs. G</span>.  Sneer if you will, but it is true that of Kate I have learned
to think upon things I never did before, and to believe that, had I been
differently educated, had my life been broadened instead of narrowed,
had I been taught to be independent, and to make my matrimonial choice
from love alone, I might have been a better mother to my daughters, and
guided the steps of my son away from ruin and dishonor.  (<i>Exit</i>,
L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>. (<i>staring after her</i>).  Have all the women gone crazy?  I have been
married twenty-five years and I never knew my wife to speak in that way
before.  It's all Kate's fault!  I must forbid this radical talk or my
household will be utterly demoralized.  But she was right in saying that
Eugene is going to ruin.  This constant struggle with money matters has
given me no time to attend to my son, and now, what shall be done?
(<i>Rises and walks back and forth</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Eugene</span>, L. U. E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Ah! have you come to tell me what you mean by your disgraceful
conduct, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Disgraceful conduct?  You are talking in enigmas to me; I'm all
right.  I have been a little jolly sometimes, to be sure, but that is no
more than all the boys are.  You had your fun when you were young, I
suppose, so why shouldn't I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  How dare you, boy, insinuate that I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Ah! come, come, father, you know you wasn't a milk-sop any more
than I am.  It's all very well for the girls, but it won't do for us
men, you know.  So, now, let me have that five hundred, that's a good
old dad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Five hundred dollars!  Do you know that I am on the verge of
ruin?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  The deuce you are!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  Nothing but a steady hand will save me.  While I am struggling
with all my might&mdash;sick enough to be in bed&mdash;to pull through, you all,
not content with being dead weights on my shoulders, run into
extravagance and profligacy.  (<i>Takes bill from desk</i>.)  The bill for my
daughter Alice's last ball dress is here, $500.  Here are two of your
champagne bills, $100.  I tell you this must be stopped.  Your
debauchery must be stopped.  You have not the strength of mind to go
through profligacy and come out solvent; if you had Kate's brains you
might, but you have not; so I tell you this must be stopped, or you will
have the pleasure of sowing the remainder of your wild oats in a
pauper's back yard, if you do not fill a drunkard's grave!  (<i>Exit</i>,

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  By Jove!  He means it every word!  I never saw him so worked up
before!  And to say I, a man, had not so much strength of mind as Kate,
he must be crazy!  But what a fix I am in!  I never dreamed but I could
get the money without any trouble before the time to take up the note
came, and if I cannot&mdash;great heavens! what I did was a crime, a State
prison offence!  State prison?  Bah! the idea is absurd, I shall get the
money some way.  I will not think of it.  It annoys me, too, to have
Lizzie under the same roof.  I have avoided her so far, but&mdash;oh! I will

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>up</i> L.).  I came to look for Miss Kate; they said she was in the
library.  Heaven knows I would not have come had I known you were here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Now, Lizzie, what is the use of making such a fuss about nothing?
Because we had a jolly little flirtation once, it is no reason why we
should go into heroics now, is it?  Come, let us be friends, Lizzie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>coming down</i> L.).  Friends with you, who broke my heart?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Nonsense! broken hearts went out of fashion years ago.  There,
forgive me, Lizzie, but what <em>is</em> the use of taking things so seriously?
Life was never made to be taken seriously.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Perhaps not for you, but for those who have hearts life is indeed
serious.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  I know it's a way women have to make themselves miserable, if they
can.  Now be sensible.  Suppose we were awful spoons once; it was very
pleasant while it lasted, but, of course, it could not last forever.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  And why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Why?  Do summer flirtations ever last?  Certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  But you said you never could be happy without me, that some day I
should be your wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  By Jove! was I so far gone as all that?  Well, I did like you
amazingly, Lizzie, but, of course, that was mere talk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>looking at him earnestly and moving towards him</i>).  You did not
mean it when you asked me to be your wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Of course not, and I did not suppose you thought I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (C.).  And you call yourself a man, you who thus trifled with the
heart of an innocent girl who loved you!  Then if you are a type of a
man, I thank heaven <em>I</em> am a woman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Now, Lizzie, don't get mad.  I did not mean any harm, 'pon my word
I didn't.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  By Jove, I believe I did treat the little girl
confounded mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  I loved not <em>you</em>, but the man I dreamed you were.  <em>You</em> I
despise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Lizzie, I am sorry it ever happened.  You see, I am a thoughtless

directions, doctor.  (<i>Exit</i>, L. 2 E.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I am sorry to see you looking pale, Miss Alice, I hope you are
not going to be ill also?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Oh, no! I have been anxious about father.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  But now all occasion for anxiety has passed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Yes, and now I am to confess the truth somewhat out of sorts
with myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  That is unfortunate, as we cannot easily get away from
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Too true.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Doughlass</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>. (<i>coming</i> L. <i>of table</i>).  Aw&mdash;good afternoon, doctor.  I thought I
would come to take you out to wide, Alice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>pettishly</i>).  Why, you have been here once to-day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;yes&mdash;you cannot complain that I am not devoted, you know!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<i>aside</i>).  I wish I could.  (<i>Aloud</i>.)  Well, I suppose I may as well
go out to ride as anything else.  (<i>Rising</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  That is right; get your hat and we will go at once.
(<span class="character">Alice</span>, <i>exit</i>, L. 2 E.)  You see I like to have her go out to wide,
for it makes the fellows all envy me, you know.  Alice is a devilish handsome girl,
now, isn't she, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Very handsome indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Yes&mdash;aw&mdash;and it's weally wough on a fellow, you know, to have to
pay his attentions in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  A lunatic asylum!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;yes&mdash;that is all I could think of whenever I have come here
for the last two weeks, what with the old man waving wound, Eugene
moping and tearing his hair, and Miss Kate having everything all her own
way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Her father has cause to be thankful that his daughter does have
everything her own way, at last.  (<i>Rises</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  You surprise me.  Aw&mdash;I have no doubt my&mdash;aw&mdash;future
sister-in-law is a very smart woman, you know, but you see a fellow is
afwaid of these smart women.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Alice</span>, L. 2 E., <i>with hat, etc</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Yes, it makes things too unequal, no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Doug</span>.  Aw&mdash;pwecisely.  (<i>Aside</i>.)  What the deuce does she mean?  (<i>Aloud</i>.)
Aw&mdash;if you are weady, my dear, we will bid the doctor good by.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Alice</span>.  Ah, yes.  We will go.  (<i>Aside, as they go up</i>.)  I will teach him
something about a woman's smartness after we are married.  (<i>Exit with</i>
<span class="character">Doughlass</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>. (R., <i>looking after them</i>).  Poor foolish couple!  I pity you both.
She is marrying him for his money, and he her for her good looks.  And
good looks fade, and money is powerless to satisfy the cravings of the
heart, and then, what?  (<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jim</span>, C.)  Well, Jim?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  If you please, sir, will you want the carriage?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Not yet.  By the by, Jim, have you fixed everything all right
with Jennie?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Not&mdash;not exactly, sir.  To tell the truth (<i>comes down</i> L.), she has
been going on worse than ever since the master has been sick, and Miss
Kate has been, as it were, the head of the family.  "There's a woman for
you!" says Jennie, "and do you dare tell me you have any business to go
and vote and Miss Kate stay at home?" says Jennie, and what can I say,
sir?  It's not for me to set myself up above Miss Kate!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Poor Jim!  Your love matters really do not glide along very
smoothly.  But they never do, Jim (<i>sighing</i>), they never do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  You're very right, sir.  To be in love is the most wearing thing I
know of.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  I fear Jennie is a sad tease.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Tease, sir!  Why, she even teases me in my dreams!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Then if she makes you so unhappy, why not give up all thoughts
of her, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Give up all thoughts of Jennie!  Never, sir!  Why, I had rather be
made that miserable that I am reduced to walking about in my bones than
give up Jennie.  No, sir!  It's a curious fact.  (<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jennie</span>, C.)  A
strange weakness in the composition of a man is that the more unhappy a
woman makes him the better he likes her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>coming down</i>, C.).  You don't say so!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Gracious Peter!  I have done it now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes, you are caught in a confession of great weakness!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  I&mdash;I&mdash;take it all back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  You can't; it's boarded.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Right, Jennie.  But what is this I hear about you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>confused</i>).  About me, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Yes, about your great aversion to our unfortunate sex?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Lor, sir, I don't know.  I suppose Jim has been telling you some
nonsense or other!  (<i>Turns and makes face at Jim</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  No, I haven't, Jennie, upon my soul I haven't.  I only told him
what you said about a man being inferior to a woman, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Oh! that was <em>all</em>, was it?  Well, Mr. Jim, you are a smart young
man, you are!  And besides, I never said anything of the kind.  The fact
is, doctor, I expressed my sentiments to him, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  And may I inquire what those sentiments are?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Oh! it's only that I don't believe in getting married and being
made a slave of and perhaps beat and told you don't know anything
because you are a woman: those are the sentiments he objects to, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Good gracious, Jennie!  Did I ever do any such thing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Of course not; you never had a chance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  But really, my good girl, I do not believe you think in your
heart quite so meanly of Jim as your words would signify.  In your zeal
for your own sex, do not be unjust to ours, for remember that is the
very thing you condemn in us.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>half crying</i>).  Well, Jim, I don't see what on earth you wanted to
go and make me out so horrid to the doctor for.  Just because I think a
good deal of his opinion, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  There, now! oh, dear! how you do fly off, to be sure.  Make you
out horrid?  I, who would think you was perfect if you would only let
up a little once in a while on me about your rights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Yes, and you went and made the doctor think that I not only wanted
my rights, which I do, but yours, too, which I don't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  You don't?  I'm sure I thought you did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>stamping foot</i>).  Oh! is there anything in the world so stupid as a
man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Stupid!  I have a good mind to get mad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>turning her back to him</i>).  I would if I were you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Well, I&mdash; (<i>Goes up</i> C., <i>then returns</i>.)  No, I can't get mad with
you, Jennie.  But won't you please just remember how you went on about
the tyranny of the sex, and all that sort of thing, and then don't blame
me if I thought you wanted to tyrannize a little.  I am sure that wasn't
stupid.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  It was absurd, then.  I only want my share, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Is that all?  Oh, Jennie (<i>gets down on knees</i>), if you will only
marry me, you shall have your share, yes, and a little more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  My share of being trampled on, do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Who said anything about being trampled on?  Well, your share of
trampling, if you must have it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  I think it is just awful of you to say that I am a tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>jumping up</i>).  Good gracious, there you go again!  How you do fly
off.  When did I ever say any such thing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Well, Jim, supposing&mdash;just supposing, you know&mdash;that I should make
up my mind to marry you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Oh, Jennie!  If you only would.  The very idea makes me so happy,
I&mdash;I could jump way to the ceiling.</p>

<p>(<i>Holds out arms to embrace her, she runs under them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Could you?  Well, don't be in too much of a hurry, because it
might hurt you when you came down, for you know I was only <em>supposing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Jennie, do you want to see me pine to a shadow and blow away with
love?  I can't stand this sort of thing any longer.  I will go away to
California, that's what I will do!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>coquettishly</i>).  But, Jim, don't you think you had better wait
until I get through <em>supposing</em>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Wait!  I will wait until I am bald if you will only promise to
have me then.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Dear me, I shouldn't want you <em>then</em>.  In fact, I couldn't think
of having you any way, if I thought you would <em>ever</em> be bald!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>very fast</i>).  Oh, I never shall; no, indeed, we are not a bald
family, there never was a bald man in it, the babies are all born with
thick heads of hair.  One of the family was scalped once, to be sure,
but it was accidental, and his hair all grew out again in a few days.
Look at mine.  (<i>Sticks it up</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>screams</i>).  Oh, don't!  Nature has made you homely enough without
your trying to help her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  But I only wanted to settle this bald question forever.  And now,
Jennie, won't you go on <em>supposing</em>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Well, supposing I should marry you some time, would you find a
minister who was willing to leave "obey" out of the marriage service?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  If there is one in America I'll find him.  For I shouldn't want to
make you swear to a lie, Jennie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  And then would you respect my rights and acknowledge equal rights
for both of us?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Of course, your rights and equal rights,&mdash;principally your rights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  Well, then, perhaps&mdash;but wait a moment; if there should ever be a
balance over equal rights, it must come on my side, must it not?
Because a man is apt to misuse his power, you know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span> (<i>going near her</i>).  You shall have all the balances.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>. (<i>edging away</i>).  I don't know but you are almost <em>too</em> willing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Now she is off on another tack.  What <em>can</em> a man do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  However, I can get a divorce if you don't keep your word, so, as
you are a pretty good fellow, Jim, I think I will condescend to try you
as a husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Hurrah!  (<i>Embraces her</i>.)  But about this condescending&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  That is one of the balances, Jim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Oh, well!  (<i>Kisses her and is about to repeat when she stops him</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jen</span>.  No, Jim.  Equal rights.  I must give you half, you know.  (<i>Kisses
him and runs off</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Jim</span>.  Equal rights ain't so bad, after all.  (<i>Goes after Jennie and runs
against</i> <span class="character">Eugene</span>, <i>who enters moodily</i>, C.)  I beg pardon, sir, but I am so
equal&mdash;happy.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  What is the matter with Jim?  Happy!  Well, I am glad some one is.
I never shall be again.  This is what my cursed easy disposition has
brought me to.  I have ruined myself and almost killed my father.  If it
was not for Kate I would blow my brains out&mdash;if I have any.  (<i>Sits
dejectedly</i>, R.)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Lizzie</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Eugene!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Lizzie, is it you?  (<i>Aside</i>.)  I am ashamed to look her in the
face.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  I have been trying to see you ever since that&mdash;that trouble, but I
never have been able to find you alone.  I thought perhaps it might be
some little comfort to you to know that I sympathized with and pitied
you, and that I had faith enough in you to believe you would redeem the
past.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>starting up</i>).  These words to me from you?  Oh, Lizzie, I am a
miserable wretch.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  You have been gay, careless, reckless, but oh, I cannot believe
you wholly bad.  My share in your thoughtless past I freely forgive.  I
wanted to tell you this, and say I hope in the future to see you worthy
the esteem of every one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  I dare not hope that, Lizzie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  But you will try?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Oh, yes!  I shall try.  But my father,&mdash;he will surely never
forgive me, will banish me from his house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Not if you tell him how penitent you are.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  He has not a heart like yours, Lizzie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  But Kate will intercede for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Kate, heaven bless her, I know she will.  What has she not done
for me already?  And to think that I once set myself up as so far above
her, and plumed myself on being a lord of creation,&mdash;I, a poor, weak
fool, not worthy to touch the hem of her garment.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Those words prove to me that you are no longer the Eugene you
were.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  I hope, I trust not.  As you say, I did not mean to be really bad.
I was inexperienced, thoughtless, eager for the pleasures of life, and
I never stopped to think of consequences.  How could you have loved
me&mdash;for you did love me once, Lizzie?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  It was your best side you showed me, Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  At first, yes; but I showed you my worst afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  The flaws in her idol cannot kill a woman's love.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Lizzie, I did not mean to break your heart.  Do you believe me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  I do; and, as I said, forgive you freely.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  For the first time I begin to realize the happiness that might
have been mine, the value of the heart I threw away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  The heart that has always been yours, Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>taking her hand</i>).  Mine!  Mine now!  What!  Do you mean to say
that you love me now, ruined and disgraced as I am, soon perhaps to be
driven from my father's door, and go forth into the world penniless and
alone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  How little you know of woman's love!  Think you it endures only
through the bright summer days of sunshine?  No, Eugene.  In the time of
darkness and sorrow a woman's love never fails.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  And would you share my fate <em>now</em>?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Would I?  Oh, how gladly!  But you forget, I am a poor girl, a
seamstress in your mother's house, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  I would indeed be unworthy of the blessing of your love should I
think of <em>that</em>.  Lizzie, your love shall raise me from the depths into
which I have fallen.  (<i>Embraces her as</i> <span class="character">Kate</span> <i>enters</i>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Eugene!  Lizzie!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (R. C.).  Do not misapprehend, Kate.  Let me explain before you
judge.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>coming down</i> L.).  Go on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>. (<i>aside</i>, R.).  Dare I hope she will approve?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Lizzie and I met&mdash;a year ago!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  What! is it possible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  Do you not remember, I told you all the first day I came to your
house?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  What do you say?  Do you mean (<i>staggers back against table for
support</i>)&mdash;can it be that it was to him&mdash;to <em>Eugene</em> that you then
referred?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  To whom else?  It was of course Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Eugene!  Oh, what a cruel mistake!  Oh, what a wrong I have done
a noble man!  Heaven forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>. (<i>going to her</i>).  Dear Kate, what is the matter? what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Do not ask me; dear, forget what I have said.  It is all right
now&mdash;yes! all right now!  Eugene&mdash;Lizzie&mdash;you do not need tell me
anymore.  I understand (<i>joins their hands</i>); I am very glad, and now will
you please leave me?  I&mdash;I would like to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Liz</span>.  You are not offended?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Offended? no indeed, child.  I am sure you have both acted for
the best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Eug</span>.  Dear Kate, with the help of my sister and my wife, I hope I may
one day be what I once thought I was&mdash;a man!  (<i>Exit</i>, C., <i>with</i>
<span class="character">Lizzie</span>, <i>who comes back to kiss</i>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Can it be true?  Has the heavy load that has lain on my heart,
at the bottom of all the other loads that have lain there of late,
really gone?  Yes&mdash;gone&mdash;all gone!  Will he, can he forgive me?  I must
see him at once!  (<i>Rings bell</i>.)  How could I for a moment mistrust him?</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Jennie</span>, C.)</p>

couple.  (<i>Exit</i>, C.)</p>

would no longer call me "strong-minded."</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="character">Dr. Endicott</span>, C.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  You sent for me, Kate?  At last we meet alone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  Yes, I sent for you to say, forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Forgive you!  For refusing me an explanation, do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  For ever having doubted you.  Oh! how can I say how bitterly I
have wronged you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  Wronged me? and how?  Do not fear: tell me all.  Whatever it may
be, it is forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I doubted you.  It seems impossible now that I could have done
so, but I did; circumstances caused me to lay the wrong-doing of another
at your door.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  If the cloud that has been between us so long has gone, I am too
thankful to give anything else a second thought.  So ask me not to
forgive you, but rather let me ask you if you love me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span>.  I love and honor you with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  As I do you.  (<i>Embraces her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Dr. E</span>.  <em>Because</em> you are strong-minded, dear.  And now we must prepare
to relieve your father's mind of the anxiety that is growing greater

Do not give yourself any uneasiness about your business.  That has gone on well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Mr. G</span>.  What, my daughter!  <em>You</em>, Kate, have done this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<i>coming around to his side</i>, R.).  Yes, dear father, my woman's wit
has been equal to the occasion.  I saw Brown myself.  I had saved up a
little money for the purpose of some day using in studying art, and with
that I settled Eugene's debts.  I have taken your place in the business

dear father.</p>

scales have fallen from my eyes at last, and I thank God for the great

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
